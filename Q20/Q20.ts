//20. Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let  cities_list : string[] = ['Karachi' , 'Sukkur' , 'Badin' , 'Nawabshah' , 'Hyderabad'];
for (let city of cities_list){
    console.log(city);
}
